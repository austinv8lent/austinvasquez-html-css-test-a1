<h2> Who am I?</h2>
</div>
<p> 
Hello, I'm Austin, a wanna be programmer looking to turn into a pro,after a lot of trial and error I decided to join a bootcamp and start my career the right way. Born and raised in Las Vegas Nevada, I've worked very many professions and have adapted to any scenario you could think of, well except for a career in coding. This will be my first step into a career I hope to stick with for a long time.

<h2>About Me </h2>
<p> As an avid user of the internet for many years, I have always been interested how many of these create websites were actually made, I've always had a picture of myself in the future working in a large team creating websites, as for working in a team I am more than comfortable with that, learning from others to see how they would tackle a problem, I have my way but I like to see how others handle a problem themselves.
   <br> 
   <br>
   Outside of programming I have a few hobbies that I am always working on.
    <ol><!-- a list of things about me-->

<li>I also practice writing as much as I can.</li>
<li>I have also learned quite a bit in editing in Adobe</li>
